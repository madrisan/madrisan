### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Open Source and Linux enthusiast since 1996, with 20+ years of experience.
currently working as _CI/CD Software Engineer_ at [qwant.com](https://www.qwant.com).
Here's a scatter plot that should help visualizing my job, learning, and programming path.
![alt tag][experiences-plot]

Iâ€™m currently busy playing with _GitLab CI_, _Kubernetes_, _Helm_, _Docker_, _SaltStack_, _Go_,
cloud technologies, and improving my knowledge in _functional programming_,
but my interests in technology and maths/physics fields cover the following areas
(somewhat ordered by decreasing degree of time accorded):
 - Maths and Environmental Sciences, currently digging around Complex and Dynamic Systems,
   Chaos Theory, Fractals, Scaling, Logic, and Global Climate Changes;
 - DevOps, Infrastructure and Configuration as Code Technologies;
 - Functional, concurrent, and Web programming (in _Python_, _Go_, _Scala_, _Node.js_);
 - Cloud Computing Technologies, Microservices Architectures;
 - Linux, Docker containers and Embedded Linux Systems.
